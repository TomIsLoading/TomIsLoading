# Hey, I'm Tom

I'm a software developer from Orlando, Florida. I make educational videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram for fun and to pass some of what I've learned over the last 4 or 5 years on to others.

I mainly talk about web stuff.

I like to sprinkle in some career related content as well every now and again.
